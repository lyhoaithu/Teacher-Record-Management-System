2. Paste it into the folder htdocs of XAMPP 
3. Follow the README.txt in the zip file of the website folder

---HOW TO RUN TEST SCRIPT---
1. Create a folder "AutomationTest" in the New Volume (D:)
2. In the AutomationTest folder create a folder name "02Projects" 
3. Extract the download zip file in the 02Projects folder.
4. Import maven project in eclipse
5. Change the jdbc link in the class "DataBaseConnection.java" in folder common
6. Change the dataPath in the Test Case and change the "pagePath" in each test to match your URL

--EXCLAIMATION--
There will be some fail Test Cases not because of the script but because the web is not logically 
developed!
There are some data violation rules but the developers didn't include the alert in the code.
The Fail test cases are mark RED in the TRMS_TestData.xlx file
